    "## Graph Data Structure\n",
    "### Graph\n",
    "A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (V) and edges (E). Graphs can be either directed or undirected. The graph might consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If there is a path between every pair of vertices, it is called a connected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Representation\n",
    "There are two common ways to represent a graph,\n",
    "* Adjacency List, space complexity $\\Theta(V+E)$, it is used to present sparse graph, a sparse graph has linear space complexity \n",
    "* Adjacency Matrices, space complexity $\\Theta(V^2)$, it is used to present dense graph, a dense graph has quadratic space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum and Maximum edges a graph can have (connected, undirected graph with no parallel edges)\n",
    "* Minimum: n-1\n",
    "* Maximum: $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Traversal\n",
    "The two most common ways to search a graph are:\n",
    "* depth-first search: The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n",
    "* breadth-first search: It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asymptotic Notation\n",
    "Suppress constant factors and lower-order terms\n",
    "#### Big O Notation\n",

Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbour B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.\n",
